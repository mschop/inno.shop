An innovative shop system for JTL.

## Why another shop system?

There is a countless amount of shops already on the market. In the case of JTL, there are plenty shops available:

- JTL-Shop
- Shopware
- ModifiedShop
- PrestaShop
- Gambio
- WooCommerce
- Shopify
- Others...

So why should one need another shop system? -> All of them are not good for large businesses.

### What does a large business need?

- Super Speeeeeed
- Super Stability (bugs are horrible)
- Super Extensibility (you will never be happy with the standard)
- Developer Friendliness (the shop should not waste your developers time)
- Super Documentation
- Open Mind / Open License
- API first (come on, it's 2020)

Ok, there is a lot more. But I think you got the point.

All shop systems mentioned above fail in at least one category if setup with JTL.

#### The problem with third party shops

All shops, not developed by JTL itself have a fundamental problem: They are not compatible with JTL logic. Depending on your
requirements, you will relatively fast get into trouble, with missing features and compatibility.

#### JTL-Shop

JTL's own shop was designed to work well for the small business. Regarding the aspects mentioned above, JTL-Shop is not good in
the following categories:

- Stability -> JTL-Shop has a strong focus on features. Sometimes the stability is not the best.
- License -> OpenSource, but proprietary
- Documentation -> Haha
- API -> Good Luck
- Developer Friendliness -> get your own impression


### So why another shop system?

Because I need it. Because I am not satisfied with the current solutions.
